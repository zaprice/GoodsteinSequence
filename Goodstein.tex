\begin{abstract}
Goodstein's theorem is an example of a natural independence phenomenon, a theorem which is "true" yet unprovable under a particular set of axioms, due to incompleteness.
We will investigate the connection between G{\"o}del's incompleteness theorems and Goodstein's theorem by exploring a few areas of mathematics, including proof theory and ordinal numbers.
This mathematical adventure is batteries-included (i.e. with proofs).
\end{abstract}

\section{Introduction}
This section will contain introductory information about our topics, including a description and statement of Goodstein's theorem.

\section{Ordinal Numbers}
This section will contain an introduction to ordinal numbers and ordinal arithmetic; these techniques are necessary to prove Goodstein's theorem in ZFC.

\section{Proof of Goodstein's Theorem}
This section will contain a proof of Goodstein's theorem, using the techniques developed in the previous section.

\section{Peano Arithmetic}
This section will contain an introduction to axiomatic systems, particulary Peano arithmetic, with a focus on the (informal) relative strength of different systems.

\section{G{\"o}del's Incompleteness Theorems}
This section will contain an informal description of G{\"o}del's incompleteness theorems, including their significance to mathematics in general.
Then, we will follow with a likely-abridged, but mostly formal, retelling of G{\"o}del's proofs.

\section{Gentzen's Consistency Proof}
This section will contain Gerhard Gentzen's proof of the consistency of Peano arithmetic, using transfinite induction to $\varepsilon_0$.
We will be careful to note how this does not contradict G{\"o}del's work, and the further implications about the problem at hand.

\section{Kirby and Paris}
This section will contain the proof of Laurence Kirby and Jeff Paris, showing that Gentzen's theorem implies the independence of Goodstein's theorem from Peano arithmetic.

\section{Epilogue}
In this section, we will conclude our mathematical adventure and reflect on what we have learned.

\section{Appendix I}
This appendix will contain a more formal detour into proof theory, mostly exploring the concept of the proof-theoretic ordinal.

\section{Appendix II}
This appendix will contain a detour into fast-growing hierarchies, showing interesting connections between computational complexity, the ordinals, and the analysis contained in Appendix I.
