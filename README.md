#Goodstein's Theorem as a Natural Independence Phenomenon: A Mathematical Adventure

##By Zachary Price

Goodstein's theorem is an example of a natural independence phenomenon, a theorem which is \"true\" yet unprovable under a particular set of axioms, due to incompleteness.
We will investigate the connection between G{\"o}del's Incompleteness Theorems and Goodstein's Theorem by exploring a few areas of mathematics, including proof theory and ordinal numbers.
This mathematical adventure is batteries-included (i.e. with proofs).
