#Goodstein's Theorem as a Natural Independence Phenomenon: A Metamathematical Adventure

Goodstein's theorem is an example of a natural independence phenomenon, a theorem which is intuitively "true" yet unprovable under a particular set of axioms due to incompleteness.
This theorem serves as an illustration of the limitations of the models we use to reason formally about mathematical objects.
We will investigate the connection between Godel's Incompleteness Theorems and Goodstein's Theorem by exploring a few areas of mathematics, including proof theory and ordinal numbers.
This mathematical adventure is batteries-included (i.e. with proofs).
